# Ronaldo Individual Highlights Maker using YOLOv8 Detection and Tracking in StreamLit.

Youtubers dedicated to sharing individual highlights of football maestros like Messi and Ronaldo often face a formidable challenge â€“ the arduous task of manually sifting through a full 90-minute match to extract the key moments. This labor-intensive process not only demands considerable time and effort but can also be prone to oversight. The problem at hand is the need for an efficient solution to sift through the entirety of a match and distill it down to the most significant moments, as much as possible. By automating the extraction of highlights, we aim to alleviate the time burden on content creators.
